#Set initial map area

This sample displays a map at a specific viewpoint defined by an envelope.

##How it works

In this sample a viewpoint (AGSViewpoint) is constructed from an envelope (AGSEnvelope). Before the map is loaded the AGSMap's' initialViewpoint is set to this viewpoint. When you assign the map to the AGSMapview the map starts to load and the map zooms to this initial area.
